# Portfolio-Project
I built this page to showcase my work to potential employers. I used Advanced CSS, which was new to me, and learned how to tailor a page to make it unique. In the future the lizard images will be pictures of future projects as well as links to the future projects, and I may even tailor the CSS in the future to make it stand out a bit more. Check out the deployed page here. https://manylizards.github.io/Portfolio-Project/
